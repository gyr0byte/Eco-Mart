        <p class="dropcap">
          Eco-technology means applying technology in a manner that is not
          harmful to nature. It is concentrated on the creation of tools and
          systems, which utilize resources in a wise and environment friendly
          manner. Most of the eco-technologies are already in our day-to-day
          lives, and perhaps we do not always realize It.
          <br /><br />
          Energy use is one of the common fields of eco-technology. In
          technologies such as the solar panels, wind power and small hydro,
          natural sources like the sun, wind and running water are used to
          generate electricity. These systems are used in homes, schools, and
          offices and can work in both villages and towns.
          <br /><br />
          Eco-technology is also useful in the management of natural resources.
          The use of rainwater collection system, drip irrigation and water
          storage tanks helps to regulate the way water is gathered and
          utilized. These are technologies that can be applied in regions where
          there is scarcity of water and save on unnecessary waste.
          <br /><br />
          In farming, eco-technology supports better planning and
          decision-making. Weather applications, soil analysis and new
          irrigation techniques enable farmers to know when to plant and the
          amount of water to apply. This assists in safeguarding land, crop, and
          the saving of time and energy.
          <br /><br />
          The eco-technology in cities and towns is witnessed in infrastructure
          and building designs. Electricity consumption is minimized by using
          buildings that are natural lit, well ventilated, and use energy saving
          materials. Homes can be made more comfortable and more affordable
          through simple design options.
          <br /><br />
          Recycling of the waste materials helps to reduce environment
          degradation. When a manufacturer launches new version of a product.
          The older versions are replaced by it. The components of the replaced
          items can be recycled and used in the manufacturing. This encourages
          minimal mining.
          <br /><br />
          Waste management is also conducted using eco-technology. Household and
          community waste is controlled by way of waste sorting systems,
          recycling tools and composting tools. These mechanisms aim at managing
          waste in a proper manner rather than throwing everything in a single
          location.
          <br /><br />
          Another field of application of eco-technology is transportation. EVP,
          ride sharing, and transportation control applications ensure to plan
          travel and lessen the fuel consumption. These technologies facilitate
          ease and efficiency in day to day travel.
          <br /><br />
          Monitoring and information sharing is the other significant component
          of eco-technology. Environmental sensors include air quality sensors,
          weather tracking systems, and mapping systems that capture information
          concerning the environment. The information aids the individual,
          society and planners to have a better idea of the environmental
          status.
          <br /><br />
          To sum up, eco-technology is concerned with balance. It is a blend of
          the contemporary technology and the sensitivity to nature and local
          requirements. Through simple and practical eco-technologies within the
          daily lives of the communities, they can strive to pass to a more
          comfortable future that would be environmentally conscious.
