      <p class="dropcap">
        The UK is set to back a vast new fleet of offshore wind projects in
        the North Sea alongside nine other European countries including
        Norway, Germany and the Netherlands. <br /><br />
        The government says the deal will strengthen energy security by
        offering an escape from what it calls the "fossil fuel rollercoaster".
        <br /><br />
        For the first time, some of the new wind farms will be linked to
        multiple countries through undersea cables known as interconnectors,
        which supporters say should lower prices across the region.
        <br /><br />
        But it could prove controversial as wind farm operators would be able
        to shop around between countries to sell power to the highest bidder -
        potentially driving up electricity prices when supply is tight.
        <br /><br />
        Energy Secretary Ed Miliband will sign a declaration on Monday at a
        meeting on the future of the North Sea in the German city of Hamburg,
        committing to complete the scheme by 2050.
        <br /><br />
        Jane Cooper, deputy CEO of industry body RenewableUK, said the deal
        would "drive down costs for billpayers" as well as increasing "the
        energy security of the UK and the whole of the North Sea region
        significantly".
        <br /><br />
        But Claire Countinho, shadow energy secretary, warned "we cannot
        escape the fact that the rush to build wind farms at breakneck speed
        is pushing up everybody's energy bills."

          Offshore wind farms in the North Sea

      <p>
        A network of undersea cables already connect the electricity grids of
        European countries - the UK has 10 such cables - but connecting wind
        farms directly to multiple countries will be a first.
        <br /><br />
        Most energy economists agree more connections between the UK and other
        European grids should reduce costs and improve the security of supply.
        <br /><br />
        The UK National Grid published a paper earlier this month suggesting
        such an arrangement could cut so-called constraint payments, made when
        wind farms are asked not to generate power because the electricity
        network is too congested.
        <br /><br />
        A separate report said UK consumers had enjoyed savings of £1.6bn from
        the nine existing undersea cables linking the UK with Europe since
        2023.
        <br /><br />
        National Grid said the cables help smooth spikes in prices because,
        thanks to time zone differences, surplus energy generated off-peak
        elsewhere can be sold cheaply to the UK.
        <br /><br />
        But interconnectors have proved controversial in Norway where there
        have been concerns that selling power to foreign countries could
        reduce supplies for Norwegian customers and therefore increase the
        price they pay.
        <br /><br />
        To stop this happening, the government brought in new rules to
        restrict electricity exports when domestic supply could be at risk.
        <br /><br />
        Norway also refused permission for a new interconnector to Scotland.
        <br /><br />
        UK secures record supply of offshore wind projects
        <br /><br />
        Nato and the European Commission are also taking part in the summit,
        which is expected to include pledges to strengthen security for
        offshore energy infrastructure amid rising concerns over sabotage and
        unsafe maritime activity.
        <br /><br />
        The agreement underlines Europe's continued commitment to wind power,
        despite renewed criticism from US President Donald Trump, who again
        attacked what he called "windmills" during a speech at the World
        Economic Forum in Davos.
        <br /><br />
        The North Sea countries pledged to develop 300 gigawatts (GW) of
        offshore wind capacity three years ago. This new deal means 100GW of
        the total will be built jointly. It is expected to say 20GW of that
        should be under way by 2030.
        <br /><br />
        China currently leads the world in offshore wind, with 43GW of the
        world's 83GW of installed capacity, according to a report last year
        from industry body RenewableUK.
        <br /><br />
        The UK ranks second, with almost 16GW already in operation. The UK
        government has awarded contracts for a further 20GW, including 8.4GW
        agreed in a record-breaking bidding round earlier this month.
        <br /><br />
        The government was criticised by the Conservatives for "locking in"
        high offshore wind prices.
        <br /><br />
        Reform has also repeatedly attacked the cost of net zero, but the Lib
        Dems and Greens both support the expansion of renewables to tackle the
        threat of climate change and boost green jobs.
        <br /><br />
        SNP and Plaid Cymru also support the growth of offshore wind, but
        argue Scotland and Wales should have control of their energy
        resources. Additional reporting by Miho Tanaka.
